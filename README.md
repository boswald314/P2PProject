README

All of our code used is in the file "finalProjectCS2.py". 

We provide a Command Line Interface to most of the functions we used, simply run the file (type 'help' for help). All callable functions take on default values that can be optionally overridden using space separated parameters. This was our main tool for exploring different graphs.

The 'run' function is our initial code to generate graphs and give an idea of how each value impacts graph structure and search efficacy. 

We created a Graph class, on which can be called a number of functions to determine graph structure and run searches. 

The Graph Class:
constructor takes three values (numberOfNodes, probabilityValue, populationDensity)
